# Full-Renewable-SanDiego
ECEN 5407: Final Project

## Abstract:
With the near- and long-term realities of climate change looming, it is the responsibility of leaders in the utility sector to fully embrace renewable energy. Thanks to economic and technical improvements over the past decades, it is now possible to have a 100% renewable energy grid. California, and San Diego in particular, has always been a leader in renewable energy implementation, with some of the highest penetration rates in the country. In this spirit, the SSDL&M utility is proud to present our bold vision for a reliable, economic, 100% renewable energy grid that will serve a portion of San Diego Countyâ€™s customers and signal to the world what is possible. Our grid design - to be implemented in 2022 - features a completely renewable generation mix of solar, wind, and landfill gas, plus various storage technologies, and utilizes advanced controls to provide fast frequency and voltage support, inertial support, and flexibility under various environmental and load scenarios.
